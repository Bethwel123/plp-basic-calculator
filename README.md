## Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
## Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.
# Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.

### Basic Calulator program
# Get user input for the first number, the second number, and the operation
